# Swift Projects Showcase

Projects included:
## 1. Vaccine Distribution Tracking App ##
- Designed for an iPad (10.2 inch to 11 inch for an optimal display) that is used to monitor vaccine or medicine distribution from all registered clinics
- Patients can then register for an appointment by entering their information, such as name, phone, birthdate, and ID number
- The app can be scaled forward by relying on REST API, and the app can also be scaled backwar by relying on Core Data to accommodate rural areas where WiFi signals are still limited
